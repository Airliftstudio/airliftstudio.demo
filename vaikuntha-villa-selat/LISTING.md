"This villa is amazing! The view of the jungle is stunning, and the pool is perfect for relaxing. It's very quiet and peaceful‚Äîjust nature all around.

### Mar√≠a (9 years on Airbnb) - 5 stars - June 2025

"We had a wonderful stay! The view is amazing, and it is very quiet there. I would recommend it 100%! The only negative detail is that the pool shown in the pictures is difficult to reach, and there are no hammocks or other places to sit."

### Chamodh (6 years on Airbnb) - 4 stars - October 2024

"The location is fantastic, offering stunning views. The food was great, and the staff were incredibly friendly. The only downside was that it got a bit warm during the day, and although our villa had two rooms, there was only one fan provided. Despite that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

### Laura (13 years on Airbnb) - 5 stars - August 2024

"The place is just beyond amazing ‚ú® even more beautiful than the pics ! You sleep with the sound of nature and river in a wooded structure well maintained with a magnificent sunset view.

### Katie (Koloa, Hawaii) - 5 stars - November 2024

"The house was one of the most beautiful places I've ever stayed in. All open air, overlooking a gorgeous valley with a river. Sunset and the stars above. I can't wait to go back."

### Hema (5 years on Airbnb) - 5 stars - October 2024

"Had an amazing stay here - peaceful and surrounded by the most beautiful scenery! As other reviews state this is an open villa which gets the feeling of being at one with nature, meaning that sometimes nature comes in, which is all part of the experience! The connection with the restaurant Fluffy.C is great and we had lovely Italian and Mexican food delivered for evening meals. A wonderful experience to have in Bali being at one with the Jungle - 100% would recommend!"

### Jo (8 years on Airbnb) - 5 stars - August 2024

## Origin of Name

Vaikuntha is the celestial home of the Hindu god, Vishnu. In their traditions, Vaikuntha is said to be located in the direction of the Capricorn constellation. Vaikuntha is sometimes translated as "the place of non-hindrance" and may also be known as Vishnupada, meaning "Supreme Abode." Located at the foot of the holy mountain of Balinese Hindu, we would like to provide our guests with "supreme abode."
