## Reviews
- **Tsitsi**: 5 stars
 After a four hour drive to our Villa, we were met with an incredible view and some dragonfruit drink. Me and my friend had an incredible week at Helene's place. It was our first time un and and  the Villa manager Budi, Redi and Kadek were absolutely lovely and made our stay incredibly memorable. I definitely miss the pool and the quiet gateaway!

- **Michael**: 5 stars
 We are already planning of heading back next year! The villa was exactly as per the pictures. The staff were amazing and exceptionally accommodating to all our needs. If you are after a location away from the usual Bali hustle and bustle and are looking to switch off and relax this is the perfect villa for you.

- **Florian**: 5 stars
 We, a family of four enjoyed a marvelous time at villa l'espoir.
Everyone starting from the driver, gardener, security guy and the two wonderful ladies where above and bejond our expectations. 
They where proactive, very helpful and warm and welcoming.
The kids (and the parents) enjoyed hanging out by the pool and swimming for hours.
We highly recommend this villa.

- **Ian**: 5 stars
 This Villa is absolutely lovely and in a beautiful setting. Having Redi & Kadek to cook for us was a real bonus, as was the 20 metre horizon pool!
If you are not into reading or games, however, you will need to do some research on things to see and do in the North. 
We took tours to enjoy the natural beauty of the Aling Aling falls & the surrounding jungle. These falls are not surrounded by tourist stuff, which is refreshing!
We also had a great day snorkeling on Menjangan Island. 
There is also yoga at the Zen Resort next door and the Bora Bora Restaurant nearby is very good.

- **Mateo**: 5 stars
 It was the most peaceful of places. It was the most relaxing of places. We woke to waves crashing in the distance and the birds chirping every morning; drifted off to a dreamy paradise with most delightful sunsets and cheery crickets! Our contact, Budi, was punctual and very helpful whenever we needed anything; Redi and Kadek made the most scrumptious meals, both breakfast and dinner! Beautiful views, beautiful grounds, beautiful experience all around and hoping to back again!!!

- **Geoff**: 5 stars
 We stayed at Helene's place in Seririt for about 10 nights and it was absolutely fantastic. The staff really looked after us and nothing was too much trouble (including our washing, ironing, cooking, shopping, etc). Perfect place to relax and unwind with great views and a fabulous pool. One minor note - the tv is in a side study, not in the lounge room, so if you're planning a family movie night, it might be a bit squishy but not a deal breaker in our eyes......
Overall a fabulous place to stay with very warm and helpful staff to look after you. 5 stars.

- **Nerina**: 5 stars
 The villa was awesome, the service impeccable before and during our stay. If you want to relax and enjoy the villa and the pool (and you don’t mind a -min- 3,5 hrs transfer from the airport), this is the absolute place for you (as it was for our family). If this is not what you ‘re looking for, we suggest you combine your stay at the villa with some nights in Ubud or with a couple of nights in a diving resort at the north of the island (as, unfortunately, the beach close to the house is full of litter).

- **Chantelle**: 5 stars
 I cannot recommend this beautiful villa enough. The photos absolutely don’t do it justice and the Manager, Budi along with the house keepers, Redi and Kadek are amazing. They are so responsive and adaptive to all our needs. We can’t wait to come back.

- **Siebe**: 5 stars
 The stay in this villa was fantastic.
The villa was very clean and the staff super friendly and always willing to help.
All rooms met expectations and the pool is just breathtaking.
Highly recommended!

- **Roberta**: 5 stars
 Hi Thankyou to Helene and the team for our beautiful north Bali stay. My daughters and I had the best time and throughly enjoyed our stay. The team catered for all our needs and booked our breakfasts and dinners pre organised the day prior. My daughter had been feeling sick from the day we arrived and the team made sure she had platters of fresh tropical fruit available to eat in the fridge. We enjoyed relaxing at the house as well as swimming with the dolphins. The property has the most amazing views out to the ocean with farms in between. We loved our stay and would definitely book again  in the future.

- **Alex**: 5 stars
 This Airbnb is an absolute dream! From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the stunning ocean views and the luxurious villa. The 30-meter pool was incredible, and we spent hours swimming and relaxing in the sun. Having staff on hand to clean and cook was a lifesaver, allowing us to truly unwind and enjoy our vacation.
The location was perfect for exploring all that the area has to offer. We visited breathtaking waterfalls, ancient temples, and went scuba diving and snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters. We even indulged in a relaxing in-house massage!
This Airbnb exceeded all of our expectations and we can't wait to return. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable vacation

- **Michal**: 5 stars
 Villa L'espoir was the best airbnb experience ever. Overall, we rate it 10* out of 5*. :-) The villa was spacious, clean, beautifully decorated, we felt at home. Redi and Kadek also contributed to the feeling of home, they fulfilled our every culinary wish, they were very kind and friendly and willing to fulfill every request. When we said goodbye to them, we felt like we were saying goodbye to family members. :-) The beds in the villa were very comfortable; each of the bedrooms had a spacious bathroom, which contributed to luxurious living. We must not forget the villa manager Desi, who was available at all times and responded immediately to our requests, for which we were very grateful, because also thanks to him we were able to enjoy a stress-free vacation. In addition, the view, the tranquility of the environment and the quick access to the beach contributed to the fact that we would return to this magical place at any time.

- **Benny**: 5 stars
 It was a very satisfying trip, Villa was beautiful, the pool was a highlight, and the service staff was very attentive, absolutely above the level of a five star hotel, highly recommend and will come again next time.

- **Saaif**: 5 stars
 Very nice stay, the housekeeping were amazing and super friendly. The manager also was always available and they arrange anything for you. Highly recommend.

- **Belinda**: 5 stars
 We usually stay around Canggu but this time we were looking for somewhere a bit more remote/away from the hustle and bustle.  We chose this Villa based on its amazing reviews.  Hand on heart the reviews are 100% accurate.
We were collected from the airport by Kadek and expertly driven over 3 hours late into the night - the drive itself a highlight!  Safely delivered into the hands of our private security who oriented our arrival - a prepared meal made for a perfect start to what was to be a perfect 7 days
The Villa itself was exactly what we were looking for - beautifully setup, comfortable, super private, serene and the bonus being expertly looked after by Redi and Kadek the housekeepers/cooks
The meals were fabulous - highly recommend the pritters with coffee as a great way to start your day!
We loved our stay
We spent the majority of our time lazing by the pool, reading books, playing cards and EATING  
Perfect
Thank you to everyone who made our holiday so very special.  X

- **Thomas**: 5 stars
 Very nice house with a great view 
Quiet environment, attentive staff.
A dream stay 
We regret not being able to stay longer 
Thanks

- **Anica**: 5 stars
 We were absolutely delighted with the accommodation and service. You really have a lot of space there and that's why we would always come back - but then with family and/or friends.  The accommodation is an absolute total package and worth every cent or rupiah!

- **Mming**: 5 stars
 Everything was so good, but due to the lack of air conditioning in the living room and the location, it was a pity that there were some bugs and there weren't many things to do around. However, the accommodation was so beautiful, and the delicious meal friendliness. Everything was good and perfect. It was the best.
