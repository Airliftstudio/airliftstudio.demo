            <p>
              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the services
              provided by Airlift Studios. By purchasing our services, you agree

            <p>
              Airlift Studios provides web design and development services for
              Airbnb property owners, including custom website design, domain
              registration, hosting, translations, and SEO optimization.

            <h2>3. Pricing and Payment</h2>
            <p>
              All prices are quoted in USD and payment is required in full
              before the website is launched and handed over to the customer. We
              offer a free demo website which is a fully functional website that
              has the same look and feel as the final product. There is no
              obligation to purchase the website after the demo is created and
              we do not collect any payment information like credit card from
              the customer.

              <p>
                The free demo will give you a good idea of what the final
                product will look like before payment. We do not offer any
                refunds, all sales are final once payment is processed.

              When the customer orders a website based on the free demo they can
              be secure in that the final launched website will have the same

              and effective, so you will not need to make any changes after
              launch. However, we will provide comprehensive step-by-step guides
              to help you make future changes independently.
