"Unforgettable stay at Villa Zori! Alessandro has thought of everything: airport transfer and rental scooters ready upon arrival. The villa is very clean, with attention to detail and equipped with all amenities. AC in every room. Well equipped kitchen with stove, coffee maker, refrigerator, freezer, sink and drinking water dispenser included! The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds, large wardrobes and USB outlets within reach. Fully equipped bathroom, with adjustable pressure shower (perfect for long hair!). Work area with desk and fast Wi-Fi available via QR code. Quiet and well-maintained exteriors, perfect for relaxation. The pool is large and perfect for cooling off, with comfortable pillows for sunbathing. The villa is located on a quiet street, but close to restaurants, shops, cafes and pharmacies. Alessandro is an exceptional host, always available and full of good advice. I will definitely return, perhaps for a longer stay. Recommended!"
