   "I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel! The welcome was truly exceptional: warm, thoughtful, and you can immediately feel the genuine, family-like atmosphere that makes the experience special. The scenery is breathtaking, even in the rain; the place remains peaceful and magical. A special mention to the pool, beautifully decorated with flowers. Everything was perfectly clean and well maintained, with great attention to detail. You can really tell that everything is done with care and love. Thank you for such a wonderful experience. Hope we'll be able to come again here soon!"

2. **Elif** (5 stars, April 2025)
   "It was an amazing place with everything!! This place belongs to a family who were always helpful about everything and super sweet and friendly. The place is exactly like the photos and the stuff is super helpful. They have arranged everything we asked for (including transportation, tours, coffee tasting etc.). I would highly recommend this place! It was clean, the swimming pool was super nice and the view from the villa was amazing."

3. **Umair** (5 stars, June 2025)
   "Bali welcomed us warmly, made us feel like family right from the jump. His humbles made us feel like we should have stayed longer in their location. provided us with great service, gave us a tour in his Jeep, which was not mentioned, he gave the tour from the kindness of his heart. I do not believe I have experienced such a great customer service, if I ever come back, I will be staying with Bali and will recommended this place to anyone visiting."

4. **Nam** (5 stars, 6 days ago)
   "Umah Bali Kuno offers a truly enchanting and restorative escape, feeling less like a stay and more like an immersion in Balinese heritage. The villa, a stunning example of traditional architecture, provides breathtaking views of lush forests, creating a profound sense of peace from the moment you arrive. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, Umah Bali Kuno prioritizes comfort with full amenities that blend seamlessly with its traditional design. Its family-run nature truly sets it apart; the warmth and genuine hospitality of the family make every guest feel cherished. Their insights into local culture enrich the experience immensely. A significant advantage is its proximity to Pura Tirta Empul. This allows for serene, early morning visits to the sacred water temple, offering a unique spiritual experience before the crowds."

    "The host responded quickly, and the staff was really kind, approachable, and responsive to requests. There are many insects and wildlife because it is surrounded by nature, but the location is the best! The breakfast was delicious and I am very satisfied. They will take you to nearby tourist destinations in a cool car! Thank you!"
