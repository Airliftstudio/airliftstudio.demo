## Reviews
- **Giorgi**: 5 stars
 Great villa, just as described! The place was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The host was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. We really enjoyed our time here – highly recommend

- **Artitaya**: 5 stars
 Absolutely loved this place! Although it’s a bit far from the city center, the peaceful atmosphere and beautiful villa made it well worth it. The property looks just like the photos on the website. The host was incredibly helpful and responsive—when we had an issue with the bathroom door, she came all the way out to fix it promptly. Truly appreciated the great service!

- **William**: 5 stars
 This Air B&B was by far one of the nicest I’ve ever stayed in. It was private. The outdoor shower was great. The beds are comfortable. The pool is huge. I would 100% recommend this spot to anyone looking for some privacy in a very cool Air B&B. Please remember you are staying in the middle of the jungle essentially in Ubud, there are occasional bugs in all of Ubud. That is part of the nature. And the sunken pit where the TV is was amazing. The bathrooms were also huge and water pressure was great. Most importantly the ACs worked great as well. Don’t pass this Air B&B up if you have the opportunity to stay here.

- **Stefan**: 5 stars
 Our host is kind. Simple cleaning and simple breakfast will provide. All in all is good. However, Indonesia is a bugs country. If you afraid or annoying the small bugs and bug one please choose the hotel.

- **Jassas**: 5 stars
 A great villa usually has a combination of factors. Things like design, amenities, and service quality.

- **Philip**: 5 stars
 We had a very nice stay and will be back. the villa was very clean and the staff communicated well.

- **Filippo Tobia**: 5 stars
 I had an amazing stay at this Airbnb! The design of the space was absolutely stunning—tastefully decorated with a perfect balance of modern elegance and cozy charm. Every detail, from the carefully chosen furniture to the artistic touches on the walls, contributed to a welcoming and stylish atmosphere. It truly felt like a home away from home.
As for cleanliness, the place was spotless. The floors, countertops, and bathroom were all immaculate, and the linens smelled fresh and looked well-maintained. It’s clear the hosts put a lot of care into ensuring everything was pristine. I felt completely at ease and comfortable throughout my stay.
Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a beautiful, clean, and comfortable place to stay!

- **Jakob**: 5 stars
 The scenic view from the open space terrace, pool, but also from the kitchen window created a very unique atmosphere. Just what we were looking for and what we dreamt of! 
Before and during our stay we had effective contact with Ratna through Whats app, and she helped to setup a chef for dinner and massage in the house. Further, with Grab app you also have a lot of flexibility for getting around, ordering food, etc. 
Location: you are close to some of the most pictured rice terraces like tegallalang and driving around the area north of Ubud is very scenic. 
Considerations: We have a 1 year and 4 years old, and the house exterior is not optimal for the 1 year. It was not a surprise and we deliberately chose fashion over practicality. 
When traveling all the way from Europe we would consider a stop around Sanur or similar before going up north next time. Due to traffic and infrastructure it took us 2,5hrs to get there. It’s a long drive after 17  hrs. flight.

- **Louise**: 5 stars
 Loved Villa Lestari beautiful setting and lovely villa. A little further out than I would have liked but it was a peaceful relaxing stay. 
Kadek our driver was lovely, happy to take us wherever we wanted to go, staff were lovely too.

- **Anxhela**: 5 stars
 Place was very beautiful, clean and comfortable. Location was bit far from city center but we knew it before booking so it was okay for us. We rented motorbikes so it was fine. They had thought of every detail in the villa. The cleaning service was upon request but it would be nice to have it in daily basis. Food delivery wouldnt come in the villa (from grab- at least our experience), but a restaurant was delivering there until 5pm (the villa had put the QR at the kitchwn).
Overall the stay was quite good and we would happily retuen again :)

- **Jinan**: 5 stars
 Peaceful, relaxing and comfy villa!

- **Nina**: 5 stars
 Very nice place, we booked another night right away. Beautiful view, quiet surroundings. Very nice contact and great scooter that was provided to us! 
Would highly recommend!

- **Gong**: 5 stars
 The house is pretty good. There are unavoidable bugs on the outdoor sofa. This is very normal. Everything is good, but you need to prepare some drinking water before you arrive.

- **Daniel**: 5 stars
 We stayed here for five nights and it felt like a jungle paradise. Everything is new and well-maintained, with a beautiful view from the garden. The pool is large and clean. However, please note that the villa is about 25 minutes from Ubud, so restaurant delivery options are limited. We absolutely loved our stay.

- **Serhii**: 5 stars
 A wonderful and modern villa with all the amenities ,corresponds to the photos in the announced. A cozy and quiet villa in the green area of Ubud,staying three nights enjoyed the pool and all the amenities !special thanks Ratna for the organization and tips during the stay ! the driver Kadek showed all the wonderful months of the area ,which added to us a lot of unforgettable experiences !in general, the villa is great,I chose for a long time and never regretted !if there are insects and other life - so this only adds paint and it is Bali that you wanted in the middle of rice fields and palms )

- **Gracjan**: 5 stars
 Beautiful cottage tucked away in a quiet, less touristy area, but still close to Ubud. Very successful stay, communicative and open host. We are very happy and recommend!

- **Mark**: 5 stars
 It is important that the villa corresponds to the photo.  Cool villa, everything inside is very beautiful. Quiet place. Had time with great pleasure. There are bats and mice in the evenings, which gives wildness to this place.

- **Mansoor**: 5 stars
 Great villa very private and beautiful views .
