## Location Information

**Selemadeg, Bali, Indonesia**

HIDE sits where Bali slips off the radar. In the foothills of Selemadeg, the roads narrow, the air cools, and the trails open into wild terrain. Run past terraced paddies, hike through jungle paths, or follow a single trail to a waterfall no one else is swimming in. You’ll cross quiet villages, meet farmers, and find routes no itinerary could ever name.

   "It’s an ABSOLUTE HIDDEN GEM. We have spent 2 years in Bali and been to many accommodations here, but this place has to be the best one we have been to so far. The staffs were extremely friendly, they made us feel at home. If you are looking for a little getaway, enjoying the quietness and nature, definitely recommend!"

2. **Talisa Maria** (9 years on Airbnb) - 5 stars
   "A wonderful place to calm down and enjoy nature. Our stay was beyond perfect. Especially because of Liaa, Oka and Wayan who were so warm and kind with our little daughter. Plus, they were cooking delicious meals à la carte and so we didn’t really miss restaurants/cafés."

   "Staying at this villa was pure bliss. Our waterfall pool was amazing, offering complete serenity with a beautiful outlook. The staff were incredibly attentive, ensuring every detail was perfect. The villa is nestled in a small village and it was fun just walking and exploring the unspoilt local area. Thanks for looking after us so beautifully."
