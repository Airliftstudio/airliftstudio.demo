This is real Bali — nature is part of the experience. You may spot geckos, frogs, butterflies, spiders, and the occasional mosquito. It's all part of the charm (we provide coils and repellent just in case!).

Also note: Bali is still a developing island. Power or Wi-Fi can occasionally drop out for short periods. We do our best to restore everything quickly and always keep you informed.

"Place looked just like the photos, beautiful accommodation. Staff were so lovely and helpful throughout stay. We were able to hire a scooter for the day also to see the surrounding area and nearby beach. Owners of the accommodation were also present and super lovely and helpful throughout stay. The Samara table cafe attached was 10/10 for every meal also. Missing the food and coffee already."

**Area Description:** Kedungu is Bali's best-kept secret — a peaceful coastal village surrounded by rice fields, palm trees, and open skies. The area is perfect for slow, soulful days. Wake up and walk to the beach, book a horse ride along the shore, or take a morning dip before coffee. For adventure seekers, nearby you'll find paintball, dirt bike rentals, and Bali Beach Glamping — a great spot for beachfront dining or yoga with a view.
