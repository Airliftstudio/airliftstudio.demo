## Property Description

Experience your childhood dreams of staying in a treehouse, even better since this one is inspired by the Hobbit movies, with round doors to enter and to access the deck. Imagine the adventure of arriving to your Hobbit treehouse by crossing a suspension bridge 15 meters up. Wake up to a symphony of bird songs and the occasional view of monkeys. Order room service from our restaurant and enjoy it on the deck or roof-top terrace. Later, go for a guided trek to a nearby secluded waterfall.

My husband and I own one of Bali's most unique boutique eco-resorts, Sebatu Sanctuary, which includes the Hobbit treehouse, and seven other distinctive accommodations. We've designed the Hobbit Treehouse for adventurers with one-of-kind features that includes a suspension bridge that leads to the rooftop terrace, a loft for kids (at least 6 years old), a queen-sized swing sofa on the ground floor, a balcony to enjoy breakfast with a view of the forested valley below, a semi-outdoor bathroom, and a bedroom with arched windows on three sides providing views of the surrounding forest.

Begin your day with a sumptuous breakfast from our awarding-winning restaurant choosing from an array of Balinese and western dishes prepared by our chefs. Room service is available and you can dine either on your balcony or go even higher up to the roof-top terrace and enjoy sublime views of the terraced rice paddies across the valley. At the end of the day, tuck yourself into a top-of-line queen-size bed, and 400 thread count cotton sheets.

Our boutique eco-resort is compliant with the Green Globe and Earth Check sustainability standards. To reduce our environmental footprint, the treehouse doesn't have air conditioning, but does have a high quality ceiling fan, and we're 600 meters above sea level and nights are typically quite cool.

Please be aware that this a real treehouse, built into one large tree. Because of that space and weight had to be limited, and can comfortably sleep two adults and one child in the loft. We have had three adults stay, but the loft space is tight, and not particularly comfortable for adults.

### Angela

**Rating**: 5 stars
**Review**: "Wow! The tree house experience and the staff totally exceeded our expectations. It really was a magical place. The communication was fantastic from start to finish. Really close to Cretya where we went for the afternoon and a driver from Sebatu came to pick us up at 9pm. We ordered food from the menu on the group chat that was set up as soon as we arrived and it was ready to eat on our return. We chose to eat it in our tree house which was amazing. The food was delicious. It was all amazing value for money, we'd have paid double it was that good!"

**Review**: "The hobbit treehouse was amazing. Especially the private walkway and the staircase down. It felt straight out of a movie. Definitely a good place to stay for a special day. Besides the treehouse the Eco pool was so unique it was really nice swimming with the fish, just be mindful that the rocks are slippery due to the natural algae. Would definitely recommend this place!"
