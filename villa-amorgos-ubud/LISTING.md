"we stayed here for 2 nights for our 10 year anniversary and It was absolutely beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful clean villa. Only think was the doors and windows dont completely seal and the room is a little hot if you keep the curtains open. but other than that it was amazing. So peaceful in the jungle."

**Lena (London, Canada)** - 5 stars
"this was a gorgeous place to stay. the view is stunning and it felt like heaven. we were about 10-15 min out of ubud center (sometimes in evening with traffic could take 30-50 min though). we would recommend eating all your meals in ubud center (watercress, donna, pica, suka espresso were all 10/10) and more worth it than eating in the airbnb. other than the food (and sometimes inconvenient distance because of traffic) this place was wonderful. would highly recommend!"

**Natalia** - 5 stars
"This was the most beautiful villa I have ever stayed in! The design and decor were absolutely stunning, and the breathtaking view made the experience even more magical. We had an amazing time here. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast was delicious. Overall, I am truly impressed with this place and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dreamy stay in Ubud!"

**Mary (Canton, Ohio)** - 5 stars
"Best place to stay in Bali. They were very accommodating. The pool was very nice. The bed was very comfortable. The food they made for us was excellent. It's a little out of the way from Ubud, so there are not restaurants around within walking distance. This place is very beautiful and the host was available for anything. Our laundry was done for us, too."

**Paris** - 5 stars
"Villa Amorgos was absolutely incredible! It was only a short trip from ubud centre but the serenity of the jungle was unmatched. Incredible view and the in villa massages were divine. We had to check out early due to a change in circumstances, but didn't want the villa to go to waste so gifted it to our friend who lives in ubud to take his family on a mini staycation. The hosts were so lovely and happy to cater to this. Amazing place, amazing price, and an amazing honeymoon we will cherish forever."

**Jessie (Downingtown, Pennsylvania)** - 5 stars
"Villa Amorgos was incredible. I chose this airbnb for our honeymoon and I am so happy that I did! We were greeted by Komang on arrival who had welcome drinks ready for us and made us feel right at home. He gave us information about the airbnb and explained the options for floating breakfast, in room massages, etc. The view from the airbnb is breathtaking, the pools are amazing. You feel completely secluded and private! The surrounding area is not very walkable but it was easy to get a gojek and Komang told us he could help us get a taxi if needed as well. There are also a few restaurants in the area that are walkable which was nice. We also had 2 floating breakfasts which were amazing! And we also had an in room couples massage which was incredible. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. It is truly a special place. It is perfect if you want a peaceful oasis away from the busy downtown, but easy enough to get downtown if desired! I would highly recommend!"

"Absolutely stunning place exactly like the pictures. The staff were so friendly and accommodating and easy to reach out to. Absolutely amazing service one of the best places we stayed in Bali, definitely recommend. Amazing sunrises too"

**Daniela (Parrish, Florida)** - 5 stars
"I have to say I had the most wonderful time at this villa. It was absolutely beautiful inside and out. The reason I booked this villa was because of the swing they have over the swimming pool and I just imagined myself there celebrating my birthday. The villa was clean, modern looking & the view from the swimming pool was absolutely breathtaking. The bed was very comfortable. The shower was amazing. I loved everything about it. 10 out of 10 recommend staying here."

"This place has bed bugs ! And when trying to reach out to manager to complain, they did not want to assist and advised me to call Airbnb for a refund. So disgusting and inconvenient! I traveled all the way from the United States on a 19hr flight to spend my birthday at a what I thought to be "luxury villa" just for you guys to have bed bugs?"
