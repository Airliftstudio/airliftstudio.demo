When the website is done building verify that the complete website is fulfilling all the Cursor rules.
Especially important steps to verify:
- All the text is accurate compared to what is written in LISTING.md
- No remaining information or images from the original example listing unless it is the same as the new Airbnb listing
- The image gallery looks good on all screen sizes.
Make any changes you think are needed to fix identified issues.
