# Airbnb Data Extraction Rule

## Purpose
Extract comprehensive information from Airbnb listings using Playwright for website generation.

## Required Data Points

### Basic Property Information
- Property name and type
- Complete location details (city, region, country)
- Property summary/tagline
- Capacity: guests, bedrooms, bathrooms, beds
- Rating

### Property Features
- Complete amenities list
- Full property description
- Key selling points and unique features

### Extract Images
- Collect the hero image from the Airbnb listings front page. It is the <img> with id="FMP-target".
- Go to https://www.airbnb.se/rooms/[ID]?modal=PHOTO_TOUR_SCROLLABLE to see all the images.
- IMPORTANT: You must collect exactly 12 different images (including the hero image) and at least one from each category if there is categories.
- For each image collect the image url (this has to be unique even compared to the hero image).
- Also collect the alt text from the image tag along with the image url. Also note if the image is in portrait or landscape aspect ratio by checking the width and height of the image. This should later be used to name the image file and describe the images in our design.
- All the collected images data should be written to the listing.md including their url, alt text, and portrait/landscape aspect ratio.

### Social Proof
- "Guest Favourite" badge or similar status indicators
- "Super Host" badge if the host has that
- Collect a minimum of 18 5-star reviews or as many as there are from https://www.airbnb.se/rooms/[ID]/reviews
- Include only name, rating, and written review.

### Location Context
- Nearby attractions and distances
- Transportation information
- Local highlights

## Extraction Process

1. **Navigate to URL**: Use Playwright to load the Airbnb listing
2. **Wait for Content**: Ensure all dynamic content has loaded
3. **Extract Systematically**: Gather all required data points
4. **Validate Data**: Ensure completeness and accuracy
5. **Document Everything**: Save all extracted data to LISTING.md

## Data Quality Requirements
- All information must be factually accurate
- Reviews must be exact quotes
- Amenities list must be complete
- There must be exactly 12 images collected

## Output Format
Save all extracted data in structured markdown format in LISTING.md within the project folder.

## Verification
- When the listing.md is finished. Verify that there are 12 unique images there. If there is not then go back to the "Extract Images" step and try again.
