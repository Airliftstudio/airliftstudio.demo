# Airbnb Data Extraction Rule

## Purpose
Extract comprehensive information from Airbnb listings and organise project file structure.

## Extract data
- Run the following command with the provided Airbnb url and wait until it is finished:
node start.js all [AIRBNB_URL] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES]
- The [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES] parameter should only be included if the user requested for the website to be translated. 
- This script will extract all the necessary information from the Airbnb listing and setup our project structure that we will use later when creating the website.

## File structure
- When the script finishes there will be a new folder named after the ID for the Airbnb listing.
- This folder is our [PROJECT_DIR] and it contains the following structure
```
Airbnb-id/
├── index.html          # Main website file that contains another example Airbnb listing
├── images/             # Folder to store images
├── css/             	# Folder containing style files
├── js/             	# Folder containing javascript files
├── listing.json	# Containing all the extracted data from the Airbnb listing
```

## File Edit Restrictions
- When building the website you are only allowed to make changes inside this project folder.
