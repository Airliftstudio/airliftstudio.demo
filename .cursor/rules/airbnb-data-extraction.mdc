# Airbnb Data Extraction Rule

## Purpose
Extract comprehensive information from Airbnb listings and organise project file structure.

## Extract data
- Run the following command with the provided Airbnb url:
node start.js all [AIRBNB_URL] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES]
- The [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES] parameter should only be included if the user requested for the website to be translated. 
- This script will extract all the necessary information from the Airbnb listing that we will use later when creating the website.

## File structure
- When the script finishes there will be a new folder named after the ID for the Airbnb listing.
- This folder is our project folder and it contains the following structure
```
Airbnb-id/
├── index.html          # Main website file that contains another example Airbnb listing
├── images/             # Folder to store downloaded images
├── css/             	# Folder containing style files
├── js/             	# Folder containing javascript files
├── webfonts/           # Folder containing fonts
├── listing.json	# Containing all the extracted data from the Airbnb listing
```

## Download images
Read the whole listing.json and select 14 images to download following these rules:
- The image with "isHero: true" will be our hero image and must be downloaded as well as all other images with "mustUse: true". 
- Select more images to download until we have a total of 14 images. 
- There should be at least one image from every category.
- Only select one portrait image.
- Select images based on their alt description. Pick images so we have good variety.
- Do not pick images with too detailed descriptions, we want more images that are showing of bigger spaces or views and not "Kitchen equipment" etc.
- The downloaded image should be named be assigned fixed names:
hero-bg.jpg, image-landscape-1.jpg,image-landscape-2.jpg,image-portrait-1.jpg,image-normal-1.jpg,image-normal-2.jpg,image-normal-3.jpg,image-normal-4.jpg,image-normal-5.jpg,image-normal-6.jpg,image-normal-7.jpg,image-normal-8.jpg,image-normal-9.jpg,image-normal-10.jpg. Make sure if there is a portrait image that is the one named image-portrait-1.jpg and only landscape images would be named image-landscape-1.jpg or image-landscape-2.jpg.
- Create one single command for downloading all of the images at the same time into the images/ folder


## File Edit Restrictions
- When building the website you are only allowed to make changes inside this project folder.
