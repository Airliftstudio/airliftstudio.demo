# Airbnb Data Extraction Rule

## Purpose
Extract comprehensive information from Airbnb listings and organise project file structure.

## Extract data
- Run the following command with the provided Airbnb url:
node scrape_airbnb.js "[AIRBNB_URL]"
- This script will extract all the necessary information from the Airbnb listing that we will use later when creating the website.

## File structure
- When the script finishes there will be a new folder named after the ID for the Airbnb listing.
- This folder is our project folder and it contains the following structure
```
Airbnb-id/
├── index.html          # Main website file that contains another example Airbnb listing
├── images/             # Folder to store downloaded images
├── LISTING.md          # Containing all the extracted data from the Airbnb listing
```

## Download images
Read the whole LISTING.md and select 12 images to download following these rules:
- The image with "isHero: true" will be our hero image and must be downloaded as well as all other images with "mustUse: true". 
- Select more images to download until we have a total of 12 images. 
- There should be at least one image from every category.
- If there is images with "Aspect: portrait" select one and the rest should be "Aspect: landscape".
- Select images based on their alt description. Pick images so we have good variety.
- Do not pick images with too detailed descriptions, we want more images that are showing of bigger spaces or views and not "Kitchen equipment" etc.
- The downloaded image should have names that describe content clearly. Include the aspect ratio in the file name. The hero image should be named hero-bg.jpg.

## File Edit Restrictions
- When building the website you are only allowed to make changes inside this project folder.
