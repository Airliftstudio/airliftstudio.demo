# Airbnb Data Extraction Rule

## Purpose
Extract comprehensive information from Airbnb listings using Playwright for website generation.

## Required Data Points

### Basic Property Information
- Property name and type
- Complete location details (city, region, country)
- Property summary/tagline
- Capacity: guests, bedrooms, bathrooms, beds
- Rating
- Price per night (add check-in/check-out dates to get pricing)

### Property Features
- Complete amenities list
- Full property description
- Key selling points and unique features

### Images
- Go to https://www.airbnb.se/rooms/[ID]?modal=PHOTO_TOUR_SCROLLABLE to see all the images
- Collect all the photos url and their category name if the gallery has that (bedroom, exterior etc).
- Collect a minimum 12 photos in total and at least one from each category
- Make sure the hero image url has the image url parameter "im_w" set to "im_w=2560"
- The rest of the images should have the "im_w" set to "im_w=1440"
- Also collect the alt text from the image tag along with the image if it is descriptive and not general like "Listing image 1". This should later be used to describe the images in our design.

### Social Proof
- "Guest Favourite" badge or similar status indicators
- "Super Host" badge if the host has that
- Collect a minimum of 20 5-star reviews or as many as there are from https://www.airbnb.se/rooms/[ID]/reviews
- Include only name, rating, and written review.

### Location Context
- Nearby attractions and distances
- Transportation information
- Local highlights
