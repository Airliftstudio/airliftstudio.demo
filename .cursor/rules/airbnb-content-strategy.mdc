# Airbnb Content Strategy Rule

## Purpose
Structure compelling content and copy that drives conversions to the Airbnb listing.

## Website content
- Follow the example in the index.html file
- Maintain the same HTML structure, sections and CSS classes as the example project
- Replace all content with new listing data from listing.md. Make sure property specific text from the example is kept.
- Replace all images with the new images from this airbnb listing. Make sure all the images from the new airbnb listing are added to the gallery section.

## Content Writing Style

### Tone Matching
- **Match property's vibe**: Casual for beach house, sophisticated for luxury villa
- **Authentic voice**: Don't oversell, be honest about what makes it special
- **Professional yet approachable**: Build trust while staying personable

### Writing Techniques
- **Focus on benefits over features**: "Wake up to ocean views" vs "Has ocean view"
- **Use sensory language**: Help visitors imagine the experience
- **Create subtle urgency**: Time-sensitive or scarcity elements
- **Accuracy first**: All content based on actual listing information
