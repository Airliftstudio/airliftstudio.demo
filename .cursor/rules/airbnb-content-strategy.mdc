# Airbnb Content Strategy Rule

## Purpose
Structure compelling content and copy that drives conversions to the Airbnb listing.

## Website content
- The current index.html in the project folder is an example of a website for an another Airbnb listing. Read the index.html file to understand its structure.
- Make changes directly in the index.html to replace the content with the new Airbnb listing data from listing.md section by section by following the specific instructions here.
- Make sure no property specific text from the original example is kept.
- Replace all images with the new images from this Airbnb listing. Make sure all the images from the new Airbnb listing are added to the gallery section (see ### Gallery Section).
- Make sure all links to Airbnb have the updated Airbnb ID (https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/[id])
- Only include the name of the location on the website if it is included in this list of locations: Canggu,Lovina,Ubud,Sanur,Uluwatu,Seminyak,Kintamani,Bali. If it is not included do not mention the adress or name of the location or just use the regional name instead, like Bali. Or use the vibe in the location name, like "Perfect beachfront location", "Perfect jungle location", "Perfect peaceful location".

## Content Writing Style

### Tone Matching
- **Match property's vibe**: Casual for beach house, sophisticated for luxury villa
- **Authentic voice**: Don't oversell, be honest about what makes it special
- **Professional yet approachable**: Build trust while staying personable

### Writing Techniques
- **Focus on benefits over features**: "Wake up to ocean views" vs "Has ocean view"
- **Use sensory language**: Help visitors imagine the experience
- **Create subtle urgency**: Time-sensitive or scarcity elements
- **Accuracy first**: All content based on actual listing information

## Specific instructions for sectional content rewrite
Instructions how to rewrite the html content from top to bottom section by section. Do not try to update the whole index.html in one go. Use these rules and go section by section.

### <head> tag
- Replace the whole <title>
- Replace all the content in the meta tags
- Replace the application/ld+json content

### <header> tag
- Set the logo in the nav bar as a short name for the property. It should be same as the domain name but can be shortened to fit the navbar better. For example if the domain name is villazoribali then the logo text should be Villa Zori.
Try to make it maximum two words.

### Hero Section
- Comment out the badge-superhost and badge-guest-favorite if the Airbnb listing does not have those badges.
- Come up with a good tagline for the hero-subtitle based on the Airbnb listing. Do not use abbreviations like "w/" etc.

### About Section
- Set the about-image to the second image 
- Update all the features. There should be 3 or 4 feature cards depending on how many features the Airbnb listing have to highlight. Make sure every feature has an appropriate icon. If unsure about if the icon exists use fa-star.
- Replace all the amenities with new one from the Airbnb listing. Make sure there is one for each amenity in the Airbnb listing.
- Every amenity item must have an appropriate icon. If unsure about if the icon exists use fa-check or a more general icon.

### Gallery Section
- Make sure all the images are replaced with the new images from images/. Do not use any duplicate images in the gallery grid.
- If there is an image that is market as "portrait" in its file name use that image as the portrait-1 image.
- Only use images marked as "landscape" for landscape-1 and landscape-2 in the gallery grid.

### Reviews Section
- Replace the two featured reviews with two very positive reviews following these criteria:
	- Both reviews must be between 60-100 words
	- Reviews must be within 20 words of each other
	- Count words manually: "This is a test" = 4 words
	- Choose complementary perspectives (e.g., location vs. amenities)
- **CRITICAL**: Remove ALL current review-mini div:s and add a new review-mini for each review in the new Airbnb listing. There should be maximum 16 review-mini elements.
- **VERIFICATION STEP**: After updating reviews, verify that NO review-mini elements contain names or content from the original example listing.

### Location Section
- Rewrite this section and the reasons why this location is perfect. Use 3-5 reasons with appropriate icons.

### Footer
- Only include WhatsApp and Instagram if they were supplied to you in the prompt together with the Airbnb listing url. If no contact information is supplied in the prompt then only include email that should be hello@[suggested-domain-name].com

## Language Translations
- This rule is only applicable if the user requested the website to be translated into other languages in the prompt. 
- Se the example in index.html for how the site supports translations to French. Add translations to the other requested languages and remove the one for French if that is not one of the requested languages.
