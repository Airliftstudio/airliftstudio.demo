# Airbnb Content Strategy Rule

## Purpose
Structure compelling content and copy that drives conversions to the Airbnb listing.

## Website content
- The current index.html in the project folder is an example of a website for an another Airbnb listing. Read the index.html file to understand its structure.
- Make changes directly in the index.html to replace the content with the new Airbnb listing data from listing.json section by section by following the specific instructions here.
- Make sure no property specific text from the original example is kept.
- Only include the name of the location on the website if it is included in this list of locations: Canggu,Lovina,Ubud,Sanur,Uluwatu,Seminyak,Kintamani,Bali. If it is not included do not mention the adress or name of the location or just use the regional name instead, like Bali. Or use the vibe in the location name, like "Perfect beachfront location", "Perfect jungle location", "Perfect peaceful location".

## Content Writing Style

### Tone Matching
- **Match property's vibe**: Casual for beach house, sophisticated for luxury villa
- **Authentic voice**: Don't oversell, be honest about what makes it special
- **Professional yet approachable**: Build trust while staying personable

### Writing Techniques
- **Focus on benefits over features**: "Wake up to ocean views" vs "Has ocean view"
- **Use sensory language**: Help visitors imagine the experience
- **Create subtle urgency**: Time-sensitive or scarcity elements
- **Accuracy first**: All content based on actual listing information

## Specific instructions for sectional content rewrite
Instructions how to rewrite the html content from top to bottom section by section. Do not try to update the whole index.html in one go. Use these rules and go section by section.

### <head> tag
- Replace the whole <title>
- Replace all the content in the meta tags
- Replace the application/ld+json content

### <header> tag
- Set the logo in the nav bar as a short name for the property. It should be same as the domain name but can be shortened to fit the navbar better. For example if the domain name is villazoribali then the logo text should be Villa Zori.
Try to make it maximum two words.

### Hero Section
- Come up with a good tagline for the hero-subtitle based on the Airbnb listing. Do not use abbreviations like "w/" etc.

### About Section
- Update all the features. There should be 3 or 4 feature cards depending on how many features the Airbnb listing have to highlight.
- Replace all the amenities with new one from the Airbnb listing. Include all the best and unique amenities offered that might be interesting for a potential guest. Do not include any amenities about number of bedrooms, beds, or baths.

### Reviews Section
- Replace the two featured reviews with two very positive reviews following these criteria:
	- Both reviews must be between 400-900 characters
	- Reviews must be within 200 characters of each other. The closer in length the better.
	- Choose complementary perspectives (e.g., location vs. amenities)

### Location Section
- Rewrite this section and the reasons why this location is perfect. Use 3-5 reasons with appropriate icons.

### Footer
- Update the contact information for instagram, WhatsApp, and email if it was included in the user prompt. If email is missing then default to hello@[suggested-domain-name].com. If instagram or WhatsApp are missing then comment out their <a> tag.
