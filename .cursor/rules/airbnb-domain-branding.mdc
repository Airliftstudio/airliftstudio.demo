# Airbnb Domain and Branding Rule

## Purpose
Generate domain name suggestions and create unique branding elements for each property.

## Domain Name Generation
- If the user has provided a domain name in the prompt use that one if available.
- If no domain name was provided or it was not available then try generate a suggestion

### Naming Strategy
- **Property + name + Location**: `villazoribali.com`, `luxuryvillazoribali.com`
- **Descriptive Variations**: `villazoricanggu.com`, `villazori.com`

### Best Practices
- Keep short and memorable (under 15 characters when possible)
- Avoid numbers and special characters like hyphens.
- Easy to spell and pronounce
- Reflect property's brand and location
- Generate the best domain name for the airbnb listing that reflect the property's brand and location

## Domain Availability Check
- Use whois to check if the domain name is available to purchase
- If not available then generate another suggestion and check with whois until you find a domain name that is available to purchase

## Rename project folder
- Rename the project folder to the selected domain name suggestion hyphenated like example: villa-zori-bali
