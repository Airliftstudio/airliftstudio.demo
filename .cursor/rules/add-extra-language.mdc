Follow these steps to add new language translations for these languages:[]

1. **Generate Translation Files**:
   ```
   node translation_workflow.js add [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES]
   ```
   This will create a translation file for every new language ([PROJECT_DIR]/js/translations_fr.js etc.). It will have the same structure as the default English translation in /js/translations_en.js.

2. **Manual Translation**:
   Go through each new translation file and add translations.
   **Requirements**:
   - Maintain exact structure - only fill in the empty strings, don't change field names or object structure.
   - Keep brand names, location names.
   - Ensure translations sound natural, appropriate and easy to understand rather than literal translations word for word.
3. Run this command in root directory: node post_build.js [PROJECT_DIR].
