# Translations Rule (Conditional)

## Purpose
This rule should only be applied as final steps after the website has been built if the user requested the website to be translated.

###Steps to translate the complete website

1. Run this command to generate translations base: node cd.. && cd.. && translation_workflow.js generate [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES].
This will create [PROJECT_DIR]/js/translations_en.js which is our default English language file. You will also see a separate translation file for each other requested language (translations_fr.js etc.). These other language files contains the exact same keys but with empty string values that needs to be translated.

2. Go through each language translation file and add translations.
Requirements:
- Maintain exact structure - only fill in the empty strings, don't change field names or object structure.
- Keep brand names, location names, and specific property features consistent.
- Ensure translations sound natural and appropriate for each target market.
When all languages are translated verify that there are no empty strings in the file. If there still is then translate them.

3. Run: node translation_workflow.js add-defaults [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES].
This will add some extra generic fixed translation keys that does not need extra translations.
