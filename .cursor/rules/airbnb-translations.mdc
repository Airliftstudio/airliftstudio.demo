# Translations Rule (Conditional)

## Purpose
This rule should only be applied as final steps after the website has been built if the user requested the website to be translated.

## Steps to translate the complete website

1. **Generate Translation Files**:
   ```
   node translation_workflow.js generate [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES]
   ```
   This will create `[PROJECT_DIR]/js/translations_en.js` which is our default English language file. You will also see a separate translation file for each other requested language (translations_fr.js etc.). These other language files contain the exact same keys as translations_en.js but with empty string values that need to be translated.

2. **Manual Translation**:
   Go through each language translation file and add translations.
   **Requirements**:
   - Maintain exact structure - only fill in the empty strings, don't change field names or object structure.
   - Keep brand names, location names.
   - Ensure translations sound natural, appropriate and easy to understand rather than literal translations word for word.

3. **Clean up Translation**:
   ```
   node translation_workflow.js clean [PROJECT_DIR]
   ```
   This is an important last step to clean up the translation files.
