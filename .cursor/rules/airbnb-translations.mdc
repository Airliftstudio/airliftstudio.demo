# Airbnb Content Translations Rule

## Purpose
To implement fully translated content and meta data.

## Usage
This rule is only applicable if the user requested the website to be translated into other languages in the prompt.

## Translation process
- Se the example in index.html and /js/translations.js for how the site supports translations to French. Add translations to the other requested languages and remove the one for French if that is not one of the requested languages.
- Start by adding all the requested languages to the language-switcher in the <header> inside the index.html.
- Next update the /js/translations.js with translations for all the requested languages.
