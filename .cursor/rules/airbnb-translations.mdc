# Translations Rule (Conditional)

## Purpose
This rule should only be applied as final steps after the website has been built if the user requested the website to be translated.

###Steps to translate the complete website

1. Run this command to generate translations base: node cd.. && cd.. && translation_workflow.js generate [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES].
This will create [PROJECT_DIR]/js/translations.js which is our translation file. The file contains multiple language sections (like 'de', 'fr', etc.) where the English (en) section has complete translations, but all other language sections have empty strings that need to be translated.

2. Go through one language section at a time and translate all the empty strings for that language.
Requirements:
- Maintain exact structure - only fill in the empty strings, don't change field names or object structure.
- Keep brand names, location names, and specific property features consistent.
- Ensure translations sound natural and appropriate for each target market.
When all languages are translated verify that there are no empty strings in the file. If there still is then translate them.

3. Run: node translation_workflow.js add-defaults [PROJECT_DIR] [COMMA_SEPERATED_LANGUAGE_CODES].
This will add some extra generic fixed translation keys that does not need extra translations.
