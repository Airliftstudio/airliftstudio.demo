Run node copy_template.js v1
This will generate a copy of a template in /templates/new_template.
I want you to read the index.html, css/styles.css and js/script.js inside /templates/new_template and modify the look and feel of this template copy so that it becomes its very own design template.
This new template should also be used for showcasing airbnb villas so the template will have to feature the same kind of information. So I only want to change the look and feel of the template.
These are the rules that must be followed in the new template:
 - Keep the navbar the same.
 - There must be a span#airbnb-rating-value that contains the airbnb rating value.
 - There must be a div.badge-superhost and div.badge-guest-favorite.
 - There must be space for 2 featured reviews in the review section. And there must be an empty div strucutre like this in the review section that later will be filled by myself manually.
 ´´
         <div class="reviews-scroll-container">
          <div id="reviews-scroll-track"></div>
        </div>
´´
 - There must be an empty element like this that will be filled by me manually later:
 ´´
        <div class="hero-capacity-row">
          <span class="hero-capacity">
          </span>
        </div>
 ´´
 - Images that you want to use must follow the naming convention of img-[type]-[index]-[width].jpg.
   Ex: img-normal-1-720w.jpg,img-normal-2-1440w.jpg,img-landscape-1-1920w.jpg,img-portrait-1-720w.jpg,
   And there should always be one hero image that can have different aspect and width also.
   Ex: img-hero-portrait-1920w.jpg,img-hero-landscape-2560w.jpg,img-hero-1920w.jpg.
   These are the possible image widths to use: 480, 720, 960, 1440, 1920, 2560
   There should be between 10-16 images used through out the website including a gallery section.
 - The new template must look good on all screen sizes. Including the gallery section.
 - There must be a footer with the same type of infomration

Rename the new_template dir to a fitting name for this new template.
When the website is finished open the index.html in the web browser.
