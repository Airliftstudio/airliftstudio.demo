Run node copy_template.js v1
This will generate a copy of a template in /templates/new_template.
I want you to read the index.html, css/styles.css and js/script.js inside /templates/new_template and modify the look and feel of this template copy so that it becomes its very own design template.

## General redesign
Update the color palett to another minimal, calm color palette.
The new template must look good on all screen sizes just like the original.
Images that you want to use must follow the naming convention of img-[type]-[index]-[width].jpg.
   Ex: img-normal-1-720w.jpg,img-normal-2-1440w.jpg,img-landscape-1-1920w.jpg,img-portrait-1-720w.jpg,
   And there should always be one hero image that can have different aspect and width also.
   Ex: img-hero-portrait-1920w.jpg,img-hero-landscape-2560w.jpg,img-hero-1920w.jpg.
   These are the possible image widths to use: 480, 720, 960, 1440, 1920, 2560
   There should be between 10-16 images used through out the website including a gallery section.

## Components to not change (only colors may be changed in these sections/elements)
- The floating CTA
- The <header> with the navbar
- The footer section
- The gallery section
- The review section

## Specific instructions for each section
Only redesign these mentioned sections and leave the other sections untouched.
These sections should be completely redesigned so that they do not look anything like the original design.

### Hero section
- Include a hero image.
- There must be a span#airbnb-rating-value that contains the airbnb rating value.
- There must be a div.badge-superhost and div.badge-guest-favorite.
- There must be an empty element like this that will be filled by me manually later for the capacity:
 ´´
        <div class="hero-capacity-row">
          <span class="hero-capacity">
          </span>
        </div>
 ´´

 ### About section
 - Feel free to redesign how every your want but keep the same type of information.

 ### Location section
 - Feel free to redesign how every your want but keep the same type of information.
 - This one clould also include a styled iframe for google maps.

Rename the new_template dir to a fitting name for this new template.
When the website is finished open the index.html in the web browser.
