## Visual Style Principles

### Color and Typography
- Use colors and fonts that match property's personality
- Create cohesive visual story throughout the page
- Ensure design feels current and professional

- Text must be easily readable on all backgrounds

### Interactive Elements
- **Scroll-triggered animations** to reveal content elegantly
- **Image hover effects** to engage visitors
- **Smooth scrolling** between sections
