# Airbnb Project Structure Rule

## Purpose
Create organized project structure for Airbnb website generation with proper file hierarchy.

## Folder Creation Requirements

### Main Project Folder
- Create folder named after property (lowercase, with hyphens)
- Example: `villa-zori-canggu/` or `serene-apartment-madrid/`
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly naming convention

### Required Files and Directories
```
property-name/
├── index.html          # Main website file
├── images/             # Downloaded property images from airbnb
├── LISTING.md          # All extracted Airbnb data
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## File Organization Standards

### Image Directory (`property-name/images/`)
- Download all images from the airbnb listing that was collected and save them with a descriptive name.
- Make sure we download the hero image with url parameter "im_w" set to "im_w=2560"
- Make sure the rest of the images are downloaded with "im_w=1440"

### Documentation Files
- **LISTING.md**: Complete extracted data from Airbnb
- **README.md**: Project documentation, domain suggestions, pricing

### Naming Conventions
- All filenames: lowercase with hyphens
- Descriptive and SEO-friendly
- No spaces or special characters
- Image names should describe content clearly

## Work Scope Limitation
**CRITICAL**: When building a new Airbnb website, you are ONLY allowed to edit and create files within this property folder. Do not modify files outside the project directory.

## File Creation Sequence
1. Create main project folder
2. Create `images/` subdirectory
3. Create LISTING.md with extracted data from the airbnb listing
4. Download and organize all property images
5. Create README.md with project documentation
6. Copy base/index.html to have that as a starting point for index.html in this project folder

## Dependencies
- Follows airbnb-data-extraction.mdc
- Prepares for airbnb-domain-branding.mdc
