## Reviews
- **⁨Jasminebasketball12⁩**: 5 stars
 This villa was absolutely breathtaking. It looked even better than the photos. The hosts were amazing!!! They were very responsive and helpful. The bathroom was to die for and the entire aesthetic of the home was 10/10. I will definitely book this villa again when i visit. I give this a million starts and a million more for customer service and communication🩵

- **Y**: 5 stars
 One of the most beautiful Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Looks exactly like the photos - if not better! We were expecting only one outdoor bath tub but turns out both bedrooms had their own gorgeous bathrooms with tubs.
Aside from the beautiful property, the team were fantastic, friendly and always responsive. We were welcomed with drinks and given helpful recommendations. 
I accidentally got locked out at 10pm and they responded immediately. I would stay here again because of the wonderful team :)
One thing to be aware of is the location is about 15-20 mins drive away from Ubud centre with nothing really around. It’s a tiny bit confusing at first. Important to note when it’s rainy because the path is very muddy and difficult for scooters/cars..hopefully they sort out the roads soon. Have some food stocked in the fridge just in case! 
Also always use the location given by the host because Gojek/Grab can end up on the wrong side of the villa!
Aside from that I would 100% recommend!

- **Cleveland**: 5 stars
 My wife and I had an incredible stay at this beautiful villa in Ubud. The villa itself is very nice, clean, and extremely comfortable, perfect for relaxing and unwinding. The private pool was a highlight, and the bathrooms were modern and well-maintained.
While there was some construction nearby, it was never a problem. The workers started and ended at respectful times, so it didn’t interfere with our peace or sleep.
What really made the experience special were the hosts, they were truly amazing. Anything we needed, they handled quickly and kindly. They helped us with laundry, arranged breakfast each morning, and even set up a flower pool and drone shoot for us, which turned out great.
Highly recommend this villa if you’re looking for a peaceful, romantic getaway in Ubud with excellent service and thoughtful attention to detail.

- **Sebastian**: 5 stars
 Great beautiful space loved it will be back
