The rice field views and sound of crickets at night made it the perfect nature escape.\nBefore our arrival, I arranged a surprise flower decoration in the bathtub for my wife, and Komang made it happen beautifully‚Äîshe was so happy! It was a special touch that made the stay even more memorable.\nThe villa was clean and well cared for. The cleaning staff were friendly and efficient. They also helped us with laundry and renting a bike, which made everything smooth and easy. \nAs expected in a natural setting, there were some bugs, but nothing out of the ordinary and not a bother at all.\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a quiet, private place to unwind, this villa is a great choice. We‚Äôd definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!"
