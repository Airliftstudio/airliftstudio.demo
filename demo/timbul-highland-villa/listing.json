The staff here were so incredible in helping me with everything I needed to support my partner. Offering fruit or plain rice to eat, giving me a lift into the town to visit a pharmacy and an ATM, they also arranged laundry for us. The breakfast was delicious and we also ordered their dinners too! We basically didn‚Äôt leave for 3 days! The staff were so friendly and attentive and the villa was so beautiful with a lovely view. Wish we could have organised some tours they offered, or even massages, but we weren‚Äôt up to it this time unfortunately."

The hotel is in the heart of rice fields and nature, and the views are stunning. \nBe careful, because nature means insects, spiders, frogs, which is quite normal. \nBreakfasts were also very good.\nThe hotel staff is lovely and very helpful. \nThe accommodation is located 10/15 minutes from Tegallalang, and about 40 minutes from Ubud. The hotel offers tours and taxis, which makes sightseeing much easier.\nWe had a lovely stay and will not hesitate to come back. \nWe would highly recommend!\nThanks again to the whole team!\nAur√©lie & Alvaro"
