The pool is incredible. We hire a scooter to go surfing only 5 minutes to the ‚Äútown‚Äù but you can get some great delivery food options so you don‚Äôt have to leave. \nBreakfast was amazing ü§ç we will definitely come back and recommend to all of our friends. Definitely stay here if you can we loved it so much. \nThanks for having us"

The bed with perfectly comfy, air con crispy cool, big tv to watch Netflix. The pool and jungle was all very lush and even though it rained it was super relaxing. The drive in was a little steep in parts but we were just in a normal rental car and managed fine. Also Putu lovely housekeeper and breakfast very simple but yum. Highly recommend!"

There is breakfast included in the room price, which is served or cooked in the Villa. The villa is private and surrounded by beautiful nature. The road can be heard, but the jungle has his own wonderful sounds so it didnt bother us. Villa was spot clean and had everything we needed for our stay."

The little house is even prettier than on the pictures, perfectly clean and offers a great view over the Balinese ‚Äújungle‚Äù. Komang, our host, was very friendly and proactive in our communication. Additionally to the stay, very good breakfast was offered daily while we were even able to choose between many different options. \nWe highly enjoyed our stay, would definitely rebook and recommend this place!"

The view from the pool at sunset is incredible. \nKomang herself is a very kind and attentive host, she made sure we that we had everything we needed!\nThe space is clean, comfortable and well designed. This is by far one of the nicest spots we have stayed at and found it very relaxing. Will definitely return!"

Komang will order your lunch/ dinner for you from local restaurants. Lovely small infinity pool. Quiet. There is a beach a 20 minute walk away but there‚Äôs not much else going on. It‚Äôs a very secluded and quiet location. Perfect for relaxing."

This home is a little of the tourist track but if you want peaceful and beautiful surroundings this is the place. \nKomang goes out of her way to make sure you have everything you need. \nHelping with every aspect of your stay. Putu was a pleasure to cook your breakfast in the morning and wayan the perfect driver to show you sights. A hideaway gem."

Highly reccomend."

The house was lovely, and I liked going down the hill to spend time by the river. Very good breakfast too!"
