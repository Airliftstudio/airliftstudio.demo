The peaceful vibe, the friendly staff, and the beautiful surroundings made it hard to leave.\nThe pool area continues to amaze me, and the quiet countryside setting is just perfect for recharging. I also love how it's close to great coffee spots, yet still feels far away from the crowd.\nCan’t recommend this place enough — and yes, I’ll definitely be back again!"

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the kitchen is tidy and well-equipped.\nThe swimming pool is stunning — a perfect spot to relax and unwind.\nI especially enjoyed the peaceful location. It's tucked away in a charming rural area of Pererenan, surrounded by greenery and tranquility. Great for chilling, resting, and just slowing down. Plus, it's close to some nice coffee shops too.\nThis will definitely be my go-to place whenever I return to Pererenan!"

The only con here, cause its located right on the side of main road, you can hear motorbikes and cars passing. Its not that bad tho, for lightsleeper better bring your earplugs. Location like 35mins away from canggu. But there are some cafes and restaurants nearby."
