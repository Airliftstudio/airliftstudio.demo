      "text": "10/10 - Would highly recommend this place to stay while in Nusa lembongan. Villa was extremely clean with beautiful scenery. Service was excellent with a mini fridge full of goodies. Putu organised a scooter rental which was dropped to our door and also organised our laundry to be dry cleaned (also picked up from and dropped back to our villa), both at great rates! Helped organise a taxi service to and from boat and helped us with our luggage on the beach. Hands down best place we stayed while travelling around Bali"

Waking up to the most incredible view of Mt Agung and the ocean was so dreamy, surf checks of shipwrecks from the hammock‚Ä¶ so hard to leave !! This location is literally the perfect balance of staying out of the hustle and bustle, while also being so close to restaurants and the beach. This stay was exactly what I needed! See you soon Mana, thanks for having me x"

It was such a peaceful and relaxing spot. There was a bit of distant construction noise at one point, but nothing disruptive. I only wish I could have stayed longer üåû"

The villa is very modern and in a very quiet setting, we didn‚Äôt have any issues with noise from the nearby building sites. \nPutu was amazing and made the whole experience flawless, he helped arrange ferry‚Äôs and taxis which was definitely worthwhile as our flight was delayed so the ferry had to be rearranged. He also organised a scooter for us and delivered it to the villa. He made everything very easy.\nWe would definitely stay again."

I loved all of the small touches that really made it feel homey. We would‚Äôve stayed far longer if we could and will come back. \nStaff were amazing and the place is spotlessly clean. Super comfy beds and quiet atmosphere meant we had the best night sleep in weeks. \nWould highly recommend, our highlight is  watching the sunrise over Mt Agung."
