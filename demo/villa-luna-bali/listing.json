  "title": "Serene Escape Surrounded by Rice Fields",
  "summary": "Experience a beautiful escape at this modern tropical villa, offering a stunning panoramic rice field view. Enjoy mornings, relax in the outdoor lounge or by the pool, and feel at home when you step into the fully equipped kitchen and stylish living area. At your convenience, a cleaner will be provided during your stay. The accommodation is cleaned 3 times a week and the pool 2 times a week free of charge.\n\nThe space\nYou‚Äôll quickly find that one of the best places to hang out on the property is by the pool or the backyard lounge area. On hot days, it‚Äôs the perfect place to sunbathe or cool down in the pool. The lounge area is great to unwind, put your feet up and read or chill with friends over a bottle or wine.\n\nThe modern open-concept kitchen is a wonderful space to prepare a meal or enjoy a morning drink. It‚Äôs spacious and fully equipped with a lovely view of the garden and backyard pool. It also benefits from the tall glass doors in front of the living room area. When they‚Äôre open, it helps circulate cool air around. The dining table is just across from the kitchen; it is perfect for a group of four. \n\nThe decorated living room has comfy sofas where you can relax, take in the view and enjoy the cooling breeze from outside. A smart TV is also available for your entertainment. \n\nOn the second floor you‚Äôll find the designated working station, designed with locally crafted furniture made of teak wood. What better place to focus than up high, overlooking a serene view of rice fields and the pool!\n\nWake up in a spacious bedroom with floor to ceiling windows that open up to the backyard pool, outside lounge area and the stunning view of rice fields as far as the eye can see. The villa comes with 2 decorated bedrooms all designed in natural soft colours with both having doors leading to the back patio. During the day opening the back doors would help provide natural air flow within the room. The ensuite bathrooms are designed in white and soft pastel blue tiles. We‚Äôll provide you with all the bathroom essentials.\n\nGuest access\nThe villa is located directly on the rice field and is barrier-free accessible on foot and by scooter/motorbikes. Parking spaces for scooters/motorbikes are available directly in front of the villa. You have to walk about 100m to the main street where free car parking spaces are available. The entire property is intended exclusively for the guest.\n\nOther things to note\nOur parking area is perfectly suited for motorbikes, offering a safe and convenient space for them. For car parking, you‚Äôll find ample space available on the main street in front of  Banjar Cepaka or right in front of Villa Kembali approx. 100m away from the villa.",

The bedrooms with bathrooms are spacious and are to the right and left of the living room. Outside, there is a covered sitting area and there is a pool with 2 sun loungers and 2 chairs. The villa is cleaned 3x week by friendly lady, the garden and swimming pool are maintained. We enjoyed it, despite the quiet location, shops and restaurants are easy accessible by taxi or motorbike. If we visit Bali again, this is definitely our 1st choice!"

It's incredibly peaceful, private, and in a local community that makes you feel like you're experiencing Bali when it was untouched and pure. The thoughtful touches in the furniture, the details in the decor, everything felt like it was done with love. I'd highly recommend this place, and now that I know how to find it, I'll definitely be back! If this villa happens to be available, I wouldn't wait much longer to book!"

Keep in mind that it is a bit of a walk with luggage where the car can't go, but I thought that was worth it. The staff is also very helpful! We have been bothered by electricity outages of a few hours due to heavy rainfall, so I recommend keeping your phone charged just to be sure. Thank you for everything!"

The long path from the main road down to the villa wasn‚Äôt accessible by car, this was a bit frustrating with all our luggage especially because there was so much rain at the time. Other than this I would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you for having us :)"
