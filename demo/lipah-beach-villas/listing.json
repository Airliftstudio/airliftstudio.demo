      "text": "Spacious and comfortable villa, immaculately clean. I was afraid of insects as there are open areas, but there is nothing to worry about. Transportation is required to get to the center of Amed, but the villa is located within walking distance of several good restaurants and the most beautiful beach in the area. Putu and his family were really kind, caring and accommodating: transport to the center of Amed, did our laundry, lunch to take away very early in the morning, because we had to leave at the small hours. Also, we were sick and Putu took care of bringing a doctor to the villa immediately. The lunches were excellent and the hosts made the children feel very welcome. I would recommend earplugs for sleeping, because like everywhere in Bali, there are dogs and roosters at night or early in the morning. We would definitely stay again. We could have stayed longer. Thank you Putu to you and your family!"
