This way, you can arrive at our property with ease and without any complications. However, if this happens, please convince your driver that it is a residential area where all sized cars go in and out daily.\n\nOther things to note\nLong before our arrival, these scenic rice fields, rivers and rainforests already had tiny insects. We thrive with the highest cleaning and pest control standards and do our best to keep them out of hotel doors. However, some creatures will inevitably pay us a visit. Natural insect repellents are available in the villa should you need one.",

The setting really is beautiful to switch off. \nIt‚Äôs roughly 20 mins outside Ubud centre - and the road to the villa is narrow, so if getting a grab it‚Äôs best to communicate this to the driver. All worth it though for a stunning setting and incredible staff."
