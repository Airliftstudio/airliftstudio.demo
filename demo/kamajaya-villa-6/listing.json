There was a sweet little bird in her nest, so cute! Surrounded by lots of butterflies and dragonflies too. \nThe cleaner, Kadek, is so kind, helpful and attentive. \nThe only thing that was a little bothersome was that the hot water ran out very quickly so I couldn‚Äôt use the bath or have a long hot shower. Overall though, a fabulous experience, great value for money."

Hosts were very responsive and kept in contact with us prior to arrival and throughout our entire stay. All the staff were very nice and helpful as well. They were able to help us with a motor bike rental that was delivered to the villa. We would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone staying in ubud!"

Ms Tari has an eye for details and will keep the villa clean and smelling good. Mr Wayan keeps a watchful eye to ensure your holiday is going as you planned. They both were available to any inquiries or requests. Thank You, for a wonderful week!!"

Cleaning services were available upon request, and although they offered it daily, we chose not to use it. Everything was quite clean, but if I had to be picky, the curtains could use a bit more cleaning.\nThe location is a bit further away from central Ubud, but that was what we wanted for our stay. We rented a bike through the villa, which made it easy for us to explore without getting stuck in traffic. If you prefer to have more dining options nearby, you might want to stay closer to the center. Overall, we had a great stay and would love to return."
