Great each room had a TV and added bonus of a washing machine. Cleaning was done every 2 days which was ample for us. There are lots of farm noises but that added to the character of the place for us and we had hired a car for our duration so being out the way was not a problem either. Loved our 7 day stay. Thank you so much."

You need at least 25 min car/bike ride to reach to center of Canggu. There is no restaurant in nearby but it is ok because gojek/ Grab delivery is good and fast.The pool was perfect. The only negative part is there is some much bugs and lizzards, etc. around the house. But the view of the house was perfect."

Whether it was a nest building wasp to replace the water tank. \nEvery day cleaning but you could cancel this if it was not necessary. \nThe modern look of the villa is a nice side effect. An offer for the gate every day. A convenient washing machine. What is useful for new guests, buy a tea towel or towel at the IndoMaret within walking distance. \nWith children/babies, it is so easy to order everything via Gojek app. Food or transport for good prices. \nThe villa is at the end of the street. At the edge of the village. \nTherefore, it is convenient to mention in the Gojek app next to address and Rooftop. \nThe airconditioners are new and fantastic. \nThe beds were fantastic. This was above expectations. 2 by 2 bed sizes for each long European. \nCount on some gecko in the house but no bigger than once a lizard of 40 cm. \nStaff was great"

      "text": "So we arrived the night before Nyepi, it wa so hard to find the place in the dark, but once we found it, turned out pretty easy to find. Just like any other villas in bali you gotta navigate into the small alleys. \nPlace wise, its new, we were the first guest to stay in it, so its all nice. Clean bed sheets, comfy bed, and cold AC. The only place that didnt have AC was the main living room, which i think its a need, because bali is so hot esp in during the day. And at night because its surrounded by trees and paddy fields, if you open the door for air, they got alot of bugs and sometimes there can be huge ones.\nThey clean the house every 2 days, they change the sheets and clean up the trash. But they need to mop the floor and sweep the floor to get rid of the bugs that fall off since every night theres always bugs that comes and they fall off the next day.  This one you can ask them to do.\nOverall i think it was a good stay, a good place, and new. Thank you for having us."
