The view was amazing, and the place nicer than the photos. Josh was great, very helpful and provided us with everything we needed, including recommendations. having a motorcycle is important to stay here, but I would definitely say that about anywhere you stay in Koh Pa-Ngan. Fully recommend! לישראלים הבנו שם שזה ממוקם בערך 25-30 דקות מכל האקשן שלנו, אפשר באופנוע אם כן באלכם לסיים את הערב במקום שקט אבל אם באלכם להיות בעניינים זה בזן ביץ׳."

Even during rainy days, the atmosphere remained peaceful and breathtakingly beautiful. The accommodation was perfect in every way, and we could not have asked for a better host. The host was incredibly kind, always reachable, and had a solution or assistance ready for anything we needed. This place is highly recommended for anyone looking for a serene and unforgettable escape into nature. We would love to return!"

The location is perfect, up in the mountains with an incredible view, very quiet and calm yet also just a 10-15 minute walk away from shops and restaurants. Also perfect for relaxing after the crowds and heat at the Full Moon Party or Waterfall Party. The hosts were also very friendly and helpful and communication was very smooth. Highly recommended!"

Bathroom is nice, but the roof was leaking, so we could not have and stuff here.\nWe really enjoyed our stay here and we hope to back here one day."

The kitchen and living area are open to the front but the bedroom is a closed room with lock at the door and airconditioning which was nice to sleep comfortably. Josh lives in another house right behind this one and was very helpful with everything."
