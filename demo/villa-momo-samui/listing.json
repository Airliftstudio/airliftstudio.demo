This place is absolutely spectacular, from check in to check out. Nothing was any trouble for Bella & Kat (Manager). The views are breath taking, the bedrooms are comfortable and clean. The pool was where we spent most of our days relaxing and soaking up the Thai sun. I really definitely recommend staying at this villa and we will definitely be back! Thank you to you all :) P.S thank you for the two beautiful birthday cakes on check in. What a lovely touch!"

The upstairs floor was our favorite place to be: the well-equipped kitchen, the dining and sofa area with the BEST views possible. The outside/ pool situation was just great!\nBella and her team were very helpful and reachable during all times. That was very much appreciated! We would love to come back and would always recommend Villa Momo. \nBut: be aware of an adventurous ride up the hill ;-) itâ€™s worth it!"

Only thing to mention is that the location is perfect for 10/10 view but it is not so easy to get there. You will always need a taxi and some taxis cannot go up the hill because it is very steep.\nThis should not be a problem because you can walk the last 300m.\nAll in all 11/10 I highly recommend it for your stay on Koh samui!"

Bella was the perfect host - arranging our airport pick up and recommending a local taxi firm who were brilliant. We used them every day. Bella was warm and friendly - very easy to talk to and she dealt with all our queries quickly. I cannot recommend this villa highly enough"

There was a small issue with the A/C in one bedroom but this was fixed within a day. Would recommend to rent a scooter. Bellas gave us some good tips for rental. Little point for improvement; we spent 4 nights and had only one towel for the shower and one for the pool. But maybe we just missed it or had to ask ðŸ˜Š"

The water is purified. Many little extras supplied if cooking. \nThis house is on a very steep hill. Itâ€™s not easy to navigate but itâ€™s doable. We hired a driver so we can explore the island. \nItâ€™s a great house for rest and relaxation."
