We felt totally comfortable there and would definitely go back. \nThe accommodation is idyllic, is beautiful with a fantastic view of the jungle and is quietly located, perfect for switching off. It's good to know that you should plan a short drive for shopping, but this underlines the tranquility and proximity to nature of the location."

Nanda is truly the best host; he was always attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.\nThe pool was in perfect condition ‚Äî the cleanest we‚Äôve seen among all the Airbnbs we stayed at. The house itself is beautifully decorated, and you can even hear the traditional ceremonies at 6 am and 6 pm, which adds a special touch to the atmosphere. Since the house is located further north, it gets a bit chilly in the mornings and evenings.\nAlso, the hot tub was the highlight! Its so big! We really enjoyed it. \nThe only challenge is that the house is a bit far from restaurants, so food delivery can take up to an hour. Luckily, there‚Äôs a nearby restaurant, and Nanda kindly brought us food from there whenever we asked.\nFinding a Grab or Gojek was never an issue, and there are plenty of things to do in the area.\nWe would love to come back again. Thank you, Nanda, for everything!"
