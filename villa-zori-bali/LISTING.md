 If you want to stay in the center of Canggu but in a quiet and peaceful place at night, then this villa is perfect for you. A very cozy place with 2 bdr, a beautiful garden with a large pool, perfect for 4 people. Very close to restaurants and bars, and just a few minutes from the beach. The host is super kind and helpful! When we come back to Canggu, we‚Äôll definitely stay here again.

 We enjoyed our stay at Villa Zori. Ale was a great host and went way beyond to help us book a driver and tour guide. He was always responsive to my queries and always willing to help. Looking forward to going back in the future. :)

 Unforgettable stay at Villa Zori!
Alessandro has thought of everything: airport transfers and rental scooters ready upon arrival.
The villa is very clean, with attention to detail and equipped with every comfort. A/C in every room.
Well-equipped kitchen with stove, coffee machine, refrigerator, freezer, dishes, and drinking water dispenser included!
The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds, large closets, and USB sockets within reach.
Fully equipped bathroom, with adjustable pressure shower (great for long hair!).
Work area with desk and fast Wi-Fi accessible via QR code.
Quiet and well-maintained exteriors, perfect for relaxing. The pool is large and great for cooling off, with comfortable cushions for sunbathing.
The villa is located in a quiet street, but close to restaurants, shops, cafes, and pharmacies.
Alessandro is an exceptional host, always available and full of great advice.
I'll definitely be back, maybe for a longer stay.
Recommended!
